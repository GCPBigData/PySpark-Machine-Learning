# PySpark-Machine-Learning

A collection of machine learning examples using PySpark

To clone and run the tutorials, please install [Anaconda Python](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python) with `pyspark` and other needed packages.

Quick through the basic, I recommend a online course from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/taming-big-data-with-apache-spark-hands-on/learn/v4/overview) and this great [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MingChen0919/learning-apache-spark).
